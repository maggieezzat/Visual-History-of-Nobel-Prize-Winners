    "The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. In this project, we aim at exploring patterns and trends in over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we try to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Who gets the Nobel Prize?\n",
    "2. What is the gender of a typical Nobel Prize winner?\n",
    "   (Males count vs. Females count)\n",
    "3. Dominant country in each field?\n",
    "4. USA dominance, visualized\n",
    "5. Capitals dominance vs. non-capitals\n",
    "6. The first woman to win the Nobel Prize\n",
    "7. Organizations vs. Individuals\n",
    "8. Oldest and youngest winners\n",
    "9. Age differences between prize categories\n",
